# PowerShell-Scripts
Various PowerShell scripts for a Systems Administrator or Systems Engineer to perform environmental tasks

## Getting Started
This is a collection of PowerShell scripts I have put together for use in my organization as a Systems Administrator. These are especially useful for Office 365 admins, as Microsoft has made old on-prem Exchange tasks only available through Exchange Online PowerShell, for organizations that have migrated to a hybrid or cloud model.

### Prerequisites
Many of these scripts require logging into Exchange Online PowerShell. Before you can access Exchange Online PowerShell, you must have permission to access it in your tenant. Please see: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/exchange/exchange-online/disable-access-to-exchange-online-powershell?view=exchange-ps to set these permissions. Once you have permission to access Exchange Online PowerShell, you can follow the guide here to access it for your tenant: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/enterprise/powershell/connect-to-exchange-online-tenants-with-remote-windows-powershell-for-delegated

## Author Note
I have been writing scripts in PowerShell for just over a year. Please exercise caution when executing these scripts and always test in a non-production environment when possible. I welcome all feedback to improve my PowerShell and GitHub skills and practices. Thanks!
